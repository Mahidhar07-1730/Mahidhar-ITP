Project Title

Goods Receipt Management System

📌 Abstract
        
The Goods Receipt Management System is a C-based console application that helps users maintain records of items received from various suppliers. The program captures supplier details along with item-specific information such as name, quantity, and price. Once the data is entered, the system automatically computes individual item totals and the overall grand total, presenting the results in a clean, formatted receipt. This project highlights the practical use of structures, arrays, loops, and input/output formatting in C, making it an excellent introduction to basic data handling and record management in programming.

📌 Project Features
✅ 1. Supplier Information Input

The system allows the user to enter the supplier’s name for easy identification.

✅ 2. Item Entry System

Users can enter:

Item name

Quantity

Price per unit

✅ 3. Automatic Calculations

The system calculates:

Total cost per item

Grand total of all items

✅ 4. Real-Time Summary Display

After all inputs, the program prints a clear and formatted goods receipt.

✅ 5. Use of Structures

The project uses struct Item to store item details efficiently.

✅ 6. Dynamic Number of Items

The program creates an array based on user input (struct Item items[n];).

✅ 7. Structured and Professional Output Format

The output resembles a real goods receipt for easy understanding and documentation.
